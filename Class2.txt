Hadoop

Hadoop Modules:
 - HDFS - Hadoop Dist file system,
 - It has map reduce
 - Yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiater)
 - Common

 What is the problem with Local System?
 Why do we need Distributed FS?

 - Storage Capacity

 ____________________

 Hbase:

 Database that runs on Hadoop

 Yahoo - Running biggest hadoop cluster

Hive
Pig

Why are Files in HDFS are not editable?
They are not in same place

Hadoop Req:
Java, Unix, Ssh passwordless

JPS: Java command
____________________

FS Operation on local file system.
cd,ls,mkdir

Any Unix command
hadoop fs -ls
hadoop fs -mkdir

hadoop fs -cat /folder/file

____________________
Mongodb vs Hadoop - Better
Different systems
If we want DB - MongoDB
File Transfer - hadoop
Hadoop is not a database.
We can run Database on Hadoop.
Running Mysql on top of windows is similar to running hbase on hadoop

YAML - Yet Another Markup Language/ Yaml Aint Markup Language

YARN - Yet Another Resource Negotiator

Block - Part of each file
____________________

Hbase stores data in HDFS

Which distribution of Hadoop to use: - Apache distribution

HortanWorks
Cloudera
MapR

JPS - Java Process Service

Hadoop Data Types:

Key
Value

____________________
Wrapper classic

Primitive DataTypes       |     Wrapper classic
--------------------        --------------------
int                           Integer
etc

____________________

Auto Boxing and Unboxing

int i2 = 5;
Integer i2 = new Integer(5);
Integer i3 = 5; ---> Auto Boxed into an object;
int i4 = new Integer(5);  --> Unbox

____________________

Hadoop data types:

IntWritable x = new IntWritable(5);
IntWritable x = new SubClassOfIntWritable(5);
IntWritable x = new AnyClassThatImplementsTheWritableInterfaceThatIntWritableImplements();

Value --> Writable
Key --> WritableComparable

StockWritable implements WritableComparable - Key
StockWritable implements Writable - Value
