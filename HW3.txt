Google has, over the past few years, built out a massively scalable infrastructure for its search engine and other applications, including Google Maps, Google Earth, GMail, Google Finance, and Google Apps. Googleâ€™s approach was to solve the problem at every level of the application stack. The goal was to build a scalable infrastructure for parallel processing of large amounts of data. Google therefore created a full mechanism that included a distributed file system, a column-family-oriented data store, a distributed coordination system, and a MapReduce-based parallel algorithm execution environment. Graciously enough, Google published and presented a series of papers explaining some of the key pieces of its infrastructure. The most important of these publications are as follows. Read the following papers, and write a short summary/report for each paper.
