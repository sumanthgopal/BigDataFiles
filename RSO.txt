The question that I choose from Group A is that What does Customer Service mean to you?

  customer service is treating customers with a friendly, helpful attitude. People remember how you make them feel, and I have found that  smiling and helping during their problems are the most important things to ensure they are satisfied

  The example of good customer service is Amazon's return policy. If a package gets lost in the mail, Amazon sends a replacement. If a customer has an issue, they have a dedicated help page and multiple ways to reach customer support. In this way, Amazon makes customers happy and satisfied.

 The other question which I choose from Group B is In what cities have you done an internship or a co-op? What is 1 thing you liked about that internship or co-op?

 I did my co-op in Boston.
 One of the most important things that I gained from co-op is newfound knowledge. This can include knowing how to fulfil tasks that are relevant to my desired career path and sharpening the skills that I already possess.

 Thank you
