US	34072304	R8I1GXQJQJF5Z	B0082XN4PA	564535335	Magellan RoadMate  Navigator	Wireless	3	3	3	Y	N	Serviceable, but missing critical information	I've been using a TomTom GPS for several years, and this Magellan for a few weeks now. Unfortunately I do not like it as much as my older TomTom (a modified 550 XXL).<br /><br />The main screen misses a lot of info that I often use on my TomTom. For example, there is no Time Left, or Current Time, or Total Miles left, or Current Speed. All it has is distance to next turn, and time of arrival. That is truly limiting IMO.<br /><br />The voice on the Magellan sounds too robotic (similar to Garmin). The TomTom voice is so much more natural. It also doesn't give you distances in decimal values. Instead of \\"one point three miles\\" it says \\"one and one third of a mile\\". Kinda forces you to convert values in your head.<br /><br />A decent feature I noticed, however, is inclusion of landmarks in the directions. For example, I can hear it tell me to \\"take a left after the school\\".<br /><br />The touchscreen requires more pressure compared to my older TomTom. Not a biggie, but I did notice it after being used to a more sensitive screen. I did not, however, experience any of the crashes the other reviewers mentioned AFTER I updated to the latest firmware. The thing restarted on me twice before the update, but never after. So I guess the random reboot issue has been fixed?<br /><br />Speaking of the software, the thing wouldn't detect the device on Windows 8. Maybe something is wrong with my Windows 8 system, but I had to use a Windows 7 laptop to update the unit.<br /><br />At this point, it's an OK GPS navigator, but I wouldn't choose this over a TomTom.	2013-04-21

I have one mounted on my bicycle and my motorcycle, never had an issue.  I've read reviews about them popping off, but I've used these for years, riding across the state on the MC and completing 200 and 300 mile rides on my bicycle, and never had an issue.  Only downside is that you have to have it out of a case, and the cradle doesn't work as a standalone case replacement.  Otherwise it does exactly what it's supposed to do.	2013-04-27

US	28702000	R3UA9FK9QVRUYH	B00BI3NL0E	742731817	HTC One M7 Screen Protector + Full Body, Skinomi TechSkin Full Coverage Skin + Screen Protector for HTC One M7 Front & Back Clear HD Film	Wireless	4	14	23	N	Y	Ultra Clear	First off let me say AWESOME customer service!! The protective skin is crystal clear and does provide the HTC one (m7) protection, especially if the user does not plan on having an additional protective outer cover case. That said here are some points that past reviews did not mention that would have been very helpful prior to purchasing.<br /><br />1. Back shield flap covers headset speaker----IMPORTANT<br /><br />The back skin has these tiny flaps that are designed to wrap around the One's sides for complete coverage. Generally, the techskin does have the necessary cuts to accommodate the One.  However, the one cut out it lacks is the cut out for the headset speaker, a small hole located at the base of the phone next to the charger port. The issue can be resolved by cutting the small area that covers the headset speaker. I mention defect because it totally obstructs a caller's ability to hear the One's user. In fact, it caused me to believe the liquid required for the techskin's application somehow got into my phone. I only noticed the flap cover over the headset speaker hole as I was removing the techskin to exchange my HTC One.<br /><br />2. The liquid spray<br />Techskin application requires the user to spray a liquid on the skin to prevent it from permanently sticking until the user aligns it properly. I was--and still am---really apprehensive about putting any sort of liquid on my phone whether it's safe or not. I suggest potential buyers watch the application video Skinomi will send them prior to delivery. Here's the link: [...]<br /><br />3. Process not overly easy<br />The sales associate at my carrier's retail store offered to apply my Techskin when it came and it took him about 20 minutes. Despite his meticulous application there were still little pieces of lint from the black Skinomi cloth.  It is worth mentioning, the associate applies a variety of adhesive skins in a month for his customers, so he is pretty versed in application process of Techskins in general.<br /><br />4. The Liquid spray<br />I mention this again because; it was a source of concern for me. Application does not require user to SPRAY THE LIQUID DIRECTLY ON THE PHONE just the skin's adhesive part. However, the liquid does drip to the sides or into the One's front speaker if the user is not careful when smoothing out the skin. Again I would suggest a potential buyer watch the video on application process prior to order to make sure he/she is okay with this part of the application process.<br /><br />5. 12 to 24 hrs. Wait for drying.<br />If you want the skin to stick well to phone and not peel turn it off let it sit in warm environment for the required 12 to 24 hrs. period. This may be a deal breaker for some, but really can apply before bed and let it set through the night for at least 8hrs. According to my resident expert at my carrier's store, warm tempered environment will gel the skin to the phone more removing any blurring areas (true---it worked for me). This does NOT mean to leave your phone in a hot car but a relatively warm area as not overheat. Also, as you use your phone the warm of the battery from use will also accomplish this.<br /><br />6. Can still have an additional outer case but must wait to put on<br />I purchased an Incipio DualPro hard-shell with silicone core cover (LOVE) and it still works great with the Skinomi. According to another reviewer, he also used Skinomi with Otterbox with no worries. Due to the closeness of the Incipio cover putting it on before the required 12 to 24 hrs. will lift the Skinomi corners and sides causing it to bubble up and peel off.<br /><br />7. The sides must be pressed down<br />The sides at first will not stay stuck to the phone unless pressure is applied and the phone is set aside to dry for the required time.<br /><br />8. Customer Care<br />The customer care at Skinomi actually have live people answer their phones. Called when I believed I would have to return my phone and would not haveany use for the techskin. Vanessa was really friendly and helpful. I would definitely purchase from them again.	2013-05-01

At first it was really great and worked fine but eventually we found out that this device drains your car battery at 10x the rate of other devices that you would ever plug into your car. So if you leave the device plugged in while your car is parked, you may end up needing to jump it later which is a huge inconvenience.   Another downside is that on its second birthday the device simply gave up on life and refused to turn on. I contacted Griffin for technical support however since the device is two years old, they told me there was simply nothing they could do for it. Now it's just left to be buried in an electronic waste yard.   If I were you, I'd find something that will at least last and doesn't attempt to murder your car battery every time your head is turned.	2011-12-30

I preped the dash affixed the mount and radar to the dash and one day later the whole thing fell off the dash. The base plate's 3m tape is insufficient at best at adhering to the dash. I tried to use Velcro to adhere the mount still no good. Now I'm going to use this industrial Velcro to see if I can get the base plate to stay on the dash. I'm using the mount on the windshield where it is obviously more built for and it has not moved, but this blocks the detector beam and defeats the purpose.<br /><br />EDIT 1<br />I found out that the alcohol swab was not enough to prep the dashboard surface. Your dash like mine might be full of old oil based cleaners and protectants and may require a gentle degreaser to get it clean. I used Purple Power on a napkin and cleaned a spot on the dash and I also used some heavy duty Velcro, since my first attempt with the backing plate ruined the 3m tape and it adhered with no problem. So if you still have the mount this is the way to make it work.<br /><br />EDIT 2<br />It just doesn't work on my dash.	2012-01-12

The Parrot Minikit+ costs somewhat less, and is probably a step below the Jabra, but all in all its a nice product.<br /><br />What's in the box?<br />* Parrot Minikit+ hand free blue tooth.<br />* Visor strap.<br />* MiniUSB/USB cable.<br />* Cigarette lighter charger.<br />* User guide.<br /><br />The Parrot is a nice compact size, simple to carry, and fits easily onto car visors. Before you use it, you need to charge it. The battery light will be red when its charging and go out when fully charged. The battery is rated for 12 hours of talk and 15 days standby. I've used mine for about 15 hours of talk between charges. Full charge takes about 3 to 3 1/2 hours.<br /><br />Controls are minimal and easy to navigate. There is a green 'call' button, a red 'end' button, and in between those a jog wheel to access the main menu and perform feature selections.<br /><br />The Minikit+ is easy to pair with phones and pairs up to ten devices (a nice bonus if you have lots of phones in your family), and will work with two phones at once. You can access only one phone's contact list at a time, but can easily switch back and forth between two phones. Upon set up it will synchronize with your phone contact list. You can override the syncing of contacts if you like.<br /><br />The Parrot detects vibration so when you get in your car, it will power on. If your phone is on it will pair to the phone. When not in use, it goes into sleep mode after a few minutes. If left in the car for a long period, it will hibernate and then wake back up when you get back in the car. This works reliably - or if you prefer, just hold down the red button for a couple of seconds when you want to turn it on or off.<br /><br />Calls are easy to make. You can browse through your contacts while the Parrot reads them aloud and pick the name you want. Or you can just say the name of teh contact you want to call and press the green button. Answering calls is just as easy, simply say 'accept' or 'reject'. Parrot calls these their &#34;magic words.&#34; When you first set up the Minikit+, the magic words are on by default, so if you don't want to use 'accept/reject', turn Magic Words off.<br /><br />The unit also has a streaming feature, so it will play music or GPS instructions if you have an A2DP compliant phone which supports music or GPS. Calls override music, so if you are listening to tunes and get a call, the music will pause.<br /><br />Operation is very simple. Call quality is decent, but not as perfect as a direct call on the phone.<br /><br />If you need to change your Minikit+ to another language, this may be done by software upgrade, using your PC and the included USB cable and downloading the language software at the Parrot website.<br /><br />There is not much to dislike about the Minikit+. It does what it is advertised to do, and does it pretty well. I would say it performs almost as well as my Jabra Freeway. The Freeway has somewhat better sound quality, and includes a free year of Voice Assist (text messages, etc. read aloud), but Jabra's product does cost a bit more as well.on.

I've had occasion to use my E5 several times over the last few months since I bought it. It has a very deep power reserve and can charge my Galaxy S3 4-6 times. That's been a relief on a few overnight trips where I didn't remember my charger. I like being able to charge my phone a few times over a few different days/weeks and not having to worry about recharging the E5 right away. So far, 3 months in, the battery is holding up perfectly.<br /><br />A couple of nitpicks: the on/off button has a light click touch and is easy to hit accidentally. Thankfully the flashlight (which seems like an unnecessary add-on in my opinion) requires a double click and has not turned on to drain the device in my glovebox. But, I do worry about that. Also, I'm not sure if turning the device on (no flashlight, nothing attached) drains it... but it hasn't failed when I've needed it. A slightly recessed button might be better.	2014-12-03

Maybe it is for you as well...	What I was looking for:<br />  Low profile<br />  Scratch protection<br />  Less slippery in hands<br />  Compliments the style of the phone<br /><br />This case met the challenge nearly perfectly. It is low profile, offers a decent amount of protection from average falls, slips in and out of pocket smoothly while still providing a surface that your skin can grip onto. It also has the ancillary benefit of illuminating the case(see pic) when I get alerts which makes is handy in noisy environments; You can set this up by going to Settings-&#62;General-&#62;Accessibility-&#62;Hearing:LED Flash for Alerts and turning on the feature.<br /><br />The case also covers the volume controls and adds some thickness to this area so it is much easier to control the volume or activate the camera shutter.<br /><br />The case does not offer much protection for the front of the phone, but there is a small amount of overlap so if you were to drop it flat, face-first it would likely survive.<br /><br />My use-case: I have no kids, I take care of my &#34;things&#34;, rarely ever drop my phone (until the slipperiness of the iPhone 6), I appreciate great style but I'm not all that stylish myself.<br /><br />My only critique of this case is that it isn't made with some unknown polymer that could be .1mm thin and provide the same protection as an otterbox or lifecase (that would be cool) and that it didn't come with a screen protection film. That said I likely wouldn't use the film anyway, so like I said, this case is perfect - for me.<br /><br />12/16/2015 UPDATE:<br />While I still think this is a fantastic case, over the last 6 months the case has begun to noticeably yellow (see photo - note that is a tear in the envelope below the case not a crack in the case). I work from home so the phone/case spend most of their time on my desk out of direct sunlight or anything else that would possibly cause the material to yellow.

I wanted a low-cost phone that would give me what I wanted - wifi connecting to be able to talk in my low-signal area at home with fave-fives capability.  I bought this phone used off ebay a year or 2 ago.  It was beat up, well worn, well used.  The battery casing wouldn't stay on securely any more.  I purchased a cheap latex cover which kept the battery case in place - problem solved.    To this day I am still using this phone.  It is very dependable.  It doesn't malfunction and shut itself off like my old nokia used to do.  The wifi works great.  It actually keeps a phone call active when switching between wifi and the T-mobile network.  Internet browsing on it is a joke due to the old outdated browser in the phone.  I woudln't use it for the cost of the internet usage anyway.  However, it is there, and so if it is a must that you be able to access the internet for say, looking up an address, it's there.    Battery life isn't wonderful.  It maybe lasts a day or 2 without charging.  You really have to charge this thing every night to keep it functioning.  But it's cheap, and it works.    I use the speaker phone often and it works okay.  The audio isn't that great but it functions and conversations are possible.    It sounds like this phone isn't that great, and it isn't... if you value current day bells and whistles and sleekness.  However, for the cost, reliability, and functionality, I say this phone is definitely worth it.  I am very glad I made this purchase as I have saved a lot of money in doing so.  If you are lucky enough to still have the fave-fives plan, you still get the little fav-five icons and you can also customize the pictures and look of the phone display.  Since I didn't want to update my contract and lose the fav-fives, but also wanted WIFI, this phone was the cheapest alternative to buy for full price.  I was worried that the newer addition of wifi enabled phones wouldn't include older fave-fives support, but this one does.  You can change yourfave-fives via the phone interface.  The text messaging was a little bothersome at first because after you send a message, the message still sits in the browser and you have to close it out.  It's a little confusing, but you get used to it.  Also to note - Wifi connection does not give you free internet browsing.  If you make calls while on wifi, it uses your minutes normally as if you were calling on-network.  Also, you have to purchase a tmobile router and connect it to your computer to enable the wifi.  The benefit is that you get a great connection in your home, which helps if you live in an area without good coverage.	2011-10-09

The execution is what lacks at times.  It works, but not always without a bit of tinkering to get a good connection.  The ports are not quite long enough for some devices to maintain a solid connection.  Additionally, the ports themselves seem weak, at risk for breaking under the weight of the device.  None of my devices snapped the ports thankfully, but it was a concern.  The iPhone port is the strongest due to its sheer size.  The micro-usb port feels the weakest, and also is the one that seems to be most difficult to connect with due to its small size.  I did not use the Samsung or LG slices, as our household does not have any devices from these manufacturers at this time.  Finally, the cost is a bit high for what you get.  It's a $40 base, and each slice is an additional $10 if purchased separately.  So, in summary, I like the concept, but the execution and actual performance don't leave me confident that it will be the final solution to my device charging needs.	2011-10-17

If the phone had worked reliably for calls I would have given it 5 stars.  The unit is very fast and handled all apps I handled with ease and is much better then other Android phones for hands free use due to the always on mic.  Battery life was a bit anemic I would have to charge the unit mid day but I am a heavy user.  Small form factor with nice size screen and great built in features like Moto Assist which can be set to detect driving, read messages, and send out a standard text message to let others know your on the road.<br /><br />All in All Motorola did very well on the sleek and powerful phone.  The reason I had to downgrade to 2 stars was that often when placing a call, the call would end immediately unless you rebooted.  Also even when in perfect reception many calls wouldn't show up in history and went straight to VM.  In addition to that for my unit if a caller called me while I was on another call I could no longer hear the conversation I was already on.  T-Mobiles Engineers were not able to help, we tried a new SIM card disabling Moto Assist app and other features with no change in the problem behavior for voice calls.  This problem did not occur on my former phone on the same network or my temp phone I'm on now.<br /><br />On the app side this worked great for everything from viewing security cameras, Visual Voicemail, GPS by voice using Google now without touching the phone which makes it great for people on the road a lot like me.<br /><br />The problem might be with T-Mobile and the Moto X, I noticed complaints about the same issues on their forums as well as some of the Android developer forums.  Regardless those issues were a show stopper for me as I can't miss work calls.  I hope others have better luck and would like to see what people say with other networks such as ATT, possibly this device would be fantastic with Verizon or ATT.<br /><br />Update 7/13: I've been following the Android forums closely and apparently the call problems are impacting phones with the latest versions of Kit Kat across multiple carriers including the dialer app service needing to be restarted or calls fail to the \\"call ended\\" msg.  Not everyone is affected but its certainly a percentage of the devices experiencing the behavior I had.  The Issues started for me after the 4.4 update, I plan to order a customized version from Motorola and test with the stock OS, if it works I will disable the updates on the phone and use it in stock mode.  If the issue is with the software and not hardware then Motorola cant be faulted for that.  Also I found that the problems impact the Google Nexus phones as well once they have been updated.  Google needs to get on top of these issues and fully test their updates before releasing them.  I will post again after I test my stock device and if the results are different then that may be the temp solution until a patched OS is released.Android forums closely and apparently the call problems are impacting phones with the latest versions of Kit Kat across multiple carriers including the dialer app service needing to be restarted or calls fail to the \\"call ended\\" msg.

The 205 / 305 are about $50-$70 more than this but if you can afford to swing it, here is why you should buy those instead...<br /><br />The 101 is identical except that is uses 2 AAA's instead of having an internal rechargeable battery.<br /><br />I bought the 201 when it first came out (~7 years ago) It was head and shoulders above the Timex product with the remote arm pod and I would have rated it 5 stars back then because it was the best of it's kind. I even used it to go geocaching.<br /><br />The problem is, I have to strongly recommend against anyone buying it today - I was \\"lucky\\" to have lost this kayaking a couple of years ago at which point I upgraded to the 305. It is SOOOOO much better that I have to now rate the 201 as one star in comparison. The 205 is the same but without heart rate.<br /><br />First, the 101/201 have a very unusual shape. The 205/305 is a bulky watch but the looong 201 prevented you from wearing gloves - a real problem when skiing, cycling, etc.<br /><br />Second - and more importantly, the 205/305 have the SIRF Star III Chipset which means it can lock on and hold the lock better.<br /><br />Imagine if you will - you're all ready to run and pumped up - whoops, you now have to wait an extra few minutes to lock your position, otherwise it cannot tell you your speed, location, etc.<br /><br />My old 201 locked on far faster than my running partner's Timex (He had to hang it on a tree while he was getting ready since it often took 5 minutes or more to lock.) the 305 can lock in 5-10 seconds most days while the 201 would lock in ~2 minutes *most* of the time but occasionally would take up to 5 minutes. If you were ~100 miles away from your prior location, the 201 would take up to 10 minutes to get a new lock. ARRRGGGGHH.<br /><br />Also the 201 would lose lock all the time when running in even moderate tree cover or heavy clouds. With the 305 I can even get a lock in my house most of the time.<br /><br />Finally, the 101/201 cannot lock IF YOU ARE MOVING! The 305 can lock even if you're riding a bicycle. I think I've even gotten a lock while driving.<br /><br />Yes the 205 and 305 cost more but with the huge difference in functionality I find it astonishing that Garmin would continue to sell the 201 given how much better the 205 and 305 are.<br /><br />p.s. Don't bother with the 405. Interesting concept but not practical. Read the reviews.<br /><br />I use mine for cycling and running, the direct link to see your workouts mapped on GOOGLE EARTH is FANTASTIC!!!! (the included software is far more stable than the junk Polar included with their HRM's.<br /><br />Heart rate strap with replaceable battery is coded and comfortable. It's better in my opinion than the Polar products (of which I've owned three)<br /><br />I'd avoid the 405 unless you really want to use this watch as a normal day to day wristwatch (check out the 405 reviews)<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's easy to leave it on and run the battery down - which is a bummer if you're just about to work out. I wish there was an \\"auto off\\" feature which would shut it down if it detects no movement or heart rate within an hour or so. Fortunately, with Li-Ion batteries, as little as a 10 minute charge gives you enough juice for a 90 minute run.<br /><br />If you've found this review to be helpful, please let me know!think I've even gotten a lock while driving.

That's a very handy feature for people such as myself who like to quantify things - I feel better knowing that I have 43% power left rather than just seeing 2 light out of 4.  The display also counts up when the powerbank is being recharged, so you have a far more accurate determination of how much time it will take to charge up. Very nice feature.<br /><br />There are also some other pluses to this powerbank. It has a significant capacity (10000mAh) but packs it into a pretty compact size, with the powerbank measuring just short of 3 inches wide and about 4.25 inches tall. The weight is a bit hefty at 8.5 ounces.<br /><br />The on/off switch can easily be found, unlike other powerbanks that seem to try their best to hide the switch. It's large, round, located on the top side, and is well-marked with a silver ring around it. It also has a nice click to it. Very well done.<br /><br />It has an LED bulb to serve as a flashlight, and the bulb is located on the side rather than the top. The positioning makes it much easier to use as a flashlight.<br /><br />The overall build quality seems solid, with well-anchored ports and a nicely seamed plastic case. It also comes with a cloth carry pouch, a USB cable and an assortment of the usual adapters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some clear misses as well. On the minor miss side, the case is a huge fingerprint magnet. One of the worst I've seen in it's ability to get smudged and display those smudges. Also, the port labels are embossed into the plastic and are pretty much impossible to read even under good light.<br /><br />The worst issue relates to the best feature - the LCD screen. It's positioned very oddly. To read the digits properly, you have to look at it with the USB ports facing down. The screen is thus at the bottom of the case, making it hard to see. That's a really silly design flub, in my opinion.<br /><br />The case bottom (the end opposite that of the USB ports) is rounded, so the powerbank can't stand up unless you position it on its edges. While a rounded end looks nice, it's just not practical.<br /><br />The size is also a bit of a problem in that it's squat and wide, making it difficult to fit into laptop bag pouches, and making it feel uncomfortable in-hand. Skinnier and taller would have been a better direction to go in when it was designed.<br /><br />Given the price point, these design flubs are a let-down, and drop my rating to 3.5 stars. Hopefully, the next version of this will address these design issues since the digital power level indicator is such a helpful feature.<br />[Sample provide for review]wn.

The charging pad arrived on time and intact. It's a hockey puck about 3 inches across and comes with a standard to micro (or mini) USB cable, the same type you plug into your phone to charge it. There is a single indicator light on it - soli gdreen means that it is getting power, but doesn't see anything to charge, flashing blue and green means that it sees something, but it isn't aligned properly to charge, and solid blue means that it is charging whatever is sitting on it. I  have a Motorola Droid Turbo, and at first I thought that they weren't going to play together. As it ended up, I have a Speck silicone rubber case, which is pretty thick - thick enough that the phone and charger thought each other were there, but they couldn't charge through it. Removing the case was simple enough, and after that it charged the phone nicely. It isn't as quick as a Turbo charge, but I also don't have to worry about forgetting that the phone is plugged in when I grab it, either.	2015-07-22

The chance to be #1 for price and function and Pivotal blew it big time. I purchased my band directly from Pivotal and have been nothing less than disappointed. Even for $12.00, this thing is a joke.<br /><br />Imagine a product that has the the following issues:<br />- Comes with no instructions<br />- Will not sync to your device consistently<br />- Loses connection every other minute<br />- Erases your data at random<br />- Has horrible customer service which is only available via email - Which they respond slower that a one legged turtle<br />- Battery life is not 5 days. Mine is a solid 16 hours if that, what a joke<br />- Extremely inaccurate step counter<br />- Cannot edit your weight within the application<br /><br />The band has promise if the company addresses its shortfalls. It secures well on your wrist with a great locking design. The face is annoying as it scratches extremely easy and the scratches show big time. The font is very small but easy to navigate from screen to screen. The problem is that without an instruction manual or help guide, you really do not know what is what and how things function.<br /><br />My biggest pet peave is the inaccuracy of step counting. I put this band to the test with my polar step counter which attaches to my leg along with my Polar band. With this I also used my Pedometer application from the App Store to come pare steps. My Polar and Pedometer devices were close with Polar being within 292 steps of the Pedometer app. This is expected as the app is a bit inaccurate. Then their is my Pivotal band. After an hour of running I record 10,789 steps. I click on my Pivotal band and it states 2,660! Are you kidding? This band is horribly inaccurate. I did this test for three days and every time the Pivotal band struggles to record steps.<br /><br />In summary, Pivotal Living is better on paper than in your wrist. The low price, poor build and lack of accuracy make this just a waste of $12.00. I honestly feel like someone stole $12.00 from my wallet. Hopefully these guys are reading these reviews and will take this feedback to heart and make the needed improvements.<br /><br />Avoid this disaster at all costs!e $12.00 from my wallet. Hopefully these guys are reading these reviews and will take this feedback to heart and make the needed improvements.<br /><br />Avoid this disaster at all costs!	2014-12-20

The mount is compact and seems sturdy, but I hope the \\"neck\\" doesn't break someday -- it looks rather thin. The mount detaches so you can carry the unit more easily in your pocket, but sometimes it has a tendency to snap off when you are adjusting the unit on your windshield.<br /><br />My only other experience with a GPS is with a Garmin that is three or four years older. The Tom-tom unit seems very up-to-date and has neighborhoods at my Garmin never recognized even after I updated the Garmin's maps. The unit is, of course, much smaller and lighter in as a screen that isn't blocked by my polarized sunglasses, unlike the older  unit.<br /><br />The tom-tom has some nice features, including a first aid guide, walking directions to the nearest emergency service, and a \\"phone for help\\" feature that tells you how to describe your current location to emergency personnel. It also has some built-in tutorials to guide you through the features, although these are hidden in a strange place, under the preferences screen.<br /><br />On the downside, the unit has a touchscreen that is flaky sometimes. Sometimes it fails to recognize a tap on the screen and other times it interprets one tap as two taps.  Using the eraser end of a pencil helps sometimes.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that, in the \\"browse map of route\\" feature under the \\"details\\" screen, you get buggy behavior. This screen is an important part of the unit, and one you need to access after you enter in a route to make sure that the unit is plotting the right route for you before you start out on your trip.<br /><br />You magnify your view on the screen by dragging the slider on the right side of the screen and you scroll around on the magnified map by dragging the map with your finger. But sometimes the unit fails to respond to your dragging and even takes you into a different screen entirely when you try to do so!<br /><br />I have found the trick to getting the best results in the screen is to drag the map by touching the screen with your fingernail only, rather than attempting to drag with the fleshy part of your fingertip.<br /><br />I am surprised nobody has mentioned this up to now. I had to return one of the units because it was especially bad in this regard, but my replacement unit also shows some tendency towards this behavior.screen is to drag the map by touching the screen with your fingernail only, rather than attempting to drag with the fleshy part of your fingertip.

From that respect, it does a pretty good job. Overall, the feel of the phone in the case is similar to when naked, although the power and volume buttons are covered. The accuracy is good, but not perfect, as far as cutouts are concerned. And, the overall finish of the case is average, with some minor bumps and rough edges here and there. Again, cutouts are probably good enough as far as headphone and microUSB connections are concerned. Finally, it does not seem to have an impact on wireless charging, from my testing.<br /><br />Features--Again, the case is supposed to be very thin, but it still provides just enough of a lip to lift the screen off the surface when face down. The rear appears to be about flush with the camera.<br /><br />Appearance (subjective)--Although it is advertised as clear, there is actually a fine white micro screened pattern on the back interior while the sides are clear. The pattern is very subtle and actually adds a nice touch, in my opinion. It seems grippy, so I'm not sure if it is supposed to keep the phone from moving around in the case or perhaps prevent any &#34;oil bubbles&#34; from appearing or both.<br /><br />Price/value--This was only $0.99 when I purchased, although at the time of this review it looks like the price has gone up to $2.99. Even at $2.99, this is easy to recommend if you're looking for something thin and unobtrusive that seems to fit well.<br /><br />Packaging--The packaging was the typical cheap plastic bag, so nothing to get excited about.	2015-05-08

A couple very minor flaws but for the price, you can't beat it.	I took a chance on this case despite the relative lack of reviews and the considerably low price as compared to the big name brands. Right out of the box, it did not dissapoint. The case is sturdy but stylish, with good quality materials and much lighter than most keyboard cases I've seen. I was especially impressed that the screen will stand up in the case at just about any angle you wish. Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze. It connected immediately and does so every time I turn it on. The connection also stays solid and the typing is flawless with no lag whatsoever. In fact, I'm using it to type this review. The keys are a little small due to the condensed size of the keyboard, but thats to be expected, and I got used to it quickly. One of the biggest advantages of this case is that the keyboard is removable for when you only want to use the tablet and just want it out of the way. I haven't tested the range of the keyboard beyond a few feet but so far there have been no issues there either.<br /><br />I only have two complaints, both of them minor. First, I wish there was a sublte bracket for the keyboard to be secured in but also easily removed. The magnet is great for holding the keyboard in place while typing, but when opening and closing the case, the keyboard usually just falls, depending on how you open it. Once the case is closed, it doesn't move so theres no risk of it falling out, but it would be nice for something to hold it in place for when the case is frequently opened and closed. The magnet just isn't strong enough. The second issue is that you pretty much have to disable the magnetic on/off function for the screen. While most cases can wake the tablet or put it to sleep just by opening and closing, this one can't get it done. When the keyboard is removed, the case won't close all the way against the screen so the screen won't turn off. When the keyboard remains in, it blocks the magnet from the screen so the Ipad can't register being closed anyway.For me, this is a non issue. Turning that function off on the Ipad did not affect my life in any way. So I have to push the home button to wake the screen, big deal. Its a neat trick from Apple, but totally unnecessary. However, if the company decided to add a magnetized bracket for the keyboard in future models, it would solve both of these complaints at once.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed. For the price, you really can't beat this. My previous case was $100 (which seems to be the going rate for the big brands) and it was total junk. For less than half the price, this case is excellent. Nothing too fancy, but it gets the job done in style. Well done.	2015-01-09

I'll be copy-and-pasting this review.  I'm sorry for the length!  I've been very happy with Tech Armor, and very unhappy with other brands.  This disparity makes me a little wordy.]<br /><br />I have tried five different brands of screen protectors.  Some were better than others in terms of clarity and touch, but all were difficult to install.  It had become routine for me to only get one use out of a 3-pack because I would pick up lint and bubbles on the first two tries.  That's not the case with Tech Armor.<br /><br />Here's where Tech Armor excels:<br /><br />1.  Installation.  The game-changer for me is the residue-free lint removal tape.  It's really the only way to get a lint-free application site, and Tech Armor is the only company I've seen include it in the package.  I've even tried to make my own tape for other brands, but I ended up getting sticky residue all over my screen.  Follow Tech Armor's instructions and you can't go wrong!<br /><br />2.  Customer Service.  If you end up having installation problems and wasting a few protectors, make sure to contact Tech Armor directly!  They will take care of you and make it right!<br /><br />3.  Choices.  The glossy and matte versions are both excellent for different reasons.  I've used both, and like both.  The HD Clear is the first protector I've ever used that didn't reduce picture quality OR touch-screen responsiveness.  The Matte protector reduces the picture quality a little bit, but eliminates smudges, fingerprints, and sun glare.  And I found the 'feel' and responsiveness of the touch-screen to be even better than with NO protector!<br /><br />Downsides:<br /><br />The only difficulty I've had was trying to line up the hole for the pinhole camera on the iPhone 5.  Take your time and get the bottom lined up right!  If necessary, you may want to try installing from the top-down rather than the bottom-up.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I'll be sticking with Tech Armor.  I use my 4S a lot when I'm out hiking.  Lots of sun and dirty fingers.  I prefer the Matte version.  My wife watches a lot of video on her iPhone 5, and doesn't get her phone as dirty as mine.  She prefers the HD Clear version.  At $6 a pack, I'd recommend that you buy one of each and decide for yourself!	2013-06-25

I paid less than what guys on the big auction site were paying.  They obviously don't check Amazon before placing their maximum bid.  The FREEWAY has made my driving experience much better.  I use both the internal speakers and the FM radio.  I found the best way to use my FREEWAY is to leave it on and let the auto feature turn it on and off as I get in and out of the car.  I had to search a lot to find an FM frequency that worked well, but I was able to find one.  Occasionaly, I stream audio from my Samsung Galaxy S 3 to my FM radio and it sounds okay.  The sound is not as good as the regular FM Radio, but when I want to listen to something else, it comes in handy.  I have had some complains from people I call, that there is occasionally a lot of background noise on the other end of the call.

I didn't have very high expectations for this case, but I was disappointed that the case didn't fit the phone properly.  It didn't click into place and one of the corners sticks up a little.  I'll be replacing both once a better version comes out.	2012-09-27

Amazing for the price, especially if you buy with 1200 minutes package, which makes the phone basically free.  But: It is a Tracfone. Simply transferring number from old Tracfone to this took a day and a couple of call to support to work out issues.  Also, Tracfone Promo codes don't apply to Android devices.  I also read if you are a heavy texter non-Android Tracfone's get you more texts for the buck.<br />In spite of the drawbacks it's worth it for people who don't want an expensive cell plan but want a full featured Android phone (including GPS).  I have a Moto G and this is as good in most respects, but the lack of front camera and rear camera flash may be show stoppers for some. The screen is bright and clear. An inexpensive 32G micro SD card will allow the installation of all the apps, music, podcasts and photos that most could ever want.  I bought one for my wife and she loves it so far.  Maybe not the best choice for low tech folks (they may find moving apps, music and photos the to micro SD card challenging) but if you are familiar at all with Android OS you should be fine with it.	2014-12-27

For the daring individual who decides not to cover up the design beauty of the iPhone (a $600-$800 device) with an unsightly case (tends to be a $20-$30 cover), it's likely that you'll still need a holster. Something to render your phone readily accessible so that you don't need to fumble in your pocket or worry about your phone flying violently away from your person during a roller-coaster ride.<br /><br />This, reader, is a holster for such an individual. Seidio includes a small paper alerting you to not simply jam your phone into the holster, but to use a finger to lever open the catch before placing your phone into the holster. Failure to do so could result in superficial damage to your phone. But nay! When the holster was brand new, the latch (via the spring that holds it) was strong enough to scuff my phone. Now that it's been a couple months, I just callously jam my phone into the holster. This has not been the cause of the damages to my phone.<br /><br />Those are mostly &#34;Oops.&#34; moments which make me wonder if my motor control centers in my brain are damaged. Don't you feel like a putz when you're holding your phone like a normal human being and then suddenly drop it onto the floor? This holster won't help you with that, but it will protect it during those times you've entrusted your phone to it. This is my third Seidio case, each one has lived at least as long as the phone.	2014-01-23

This screen protector blows away the previous one I had in terms of quality and ease of application.  When I had to replace the one sold to me by the Verizon store, I bought a no name cheap protector.  When that one came off, I chose this glass screen protector.  I will never use a non glass protector again.  As with any screen protector, you must make sure that the screen of your device is completely clean and that your hands are free of as much dirt and oil as possible.  Included was an alcohol prep pad, lint free cloth, and some sticky tape to help you get all the dust off your screen.  The only thing that could have made it even better would be the inclusion of gloves for your hands.  I used some of my own gloves to make sure my hands couldn't contaminate the area.  I had no trouble getting bubbles out.  I was even able to gently lift the corner to remove a bit of hair that my cat had put there.  I expect this product to last quite a while.	2015-05-30

I enjoy this product quite a bit. I received the black one and it complements the watch very well. It is small, looks great on my desk, and is really easy to move out of the way when you need to. My only issue with it (literally the only reason it is a 4 star review and not a 5 star review) is that the cut out for the wire doesn't hold in at the top. It secures the wire really well at the curve near the bottom but at the top it sticks out maybe a quarter of an inch. Overall I enjoy the product and will recommend it to people that want a watch stand that doesn't cost $60 like the competition.	2015-06-01

For the price, these headphones are awesome! The sound clarity is clear, the bass is just right. The comfort, hardly even feel them. I've worked out with these head phones, they stay snug. Only when I'm sweating excessively I'll have to re-adjust them a bit. They come with different rubber fittings depending on the size of your ears. They're quick to charge, about 20-30 min using a 3amp USB charger and will give me about 7 hours of continuous music. Phone calls are easy breezy, people on the other end hear me perfectly fine. Again, do not expect brain rattling bass, but compared to other ear buds, these are amazing! I've tried out Beats head phones...I seriously cannot understand why fools pay so much for that junk when these are actually comparable to Beats. That's how good they are! I got the volume on max listening to Skrillex, no distortion, bass sounds rich. Now listening to Dimitri Vegas - Peoject T...same deal, nice clear crisp audio with decent bass.

The product works as advertised and was very easy to install. Keep in mind when you buy one of these that it may not hold enough power to fix your light dimming problem. Most newer cars have so many electrical features (ie; power windows, doors, cooling systems and upgraded stereos) that all the power that the alternator provides is used. The only way to truly get rid of the light dimming effect from bass rich music is to add a high output alternator.	2011-06-11

HD Radio, Bluetooth Audio, Bluetooth Phone, DVD player, Cheap option to add a GPS unit to it.    The terrible part is, it does not work reliably or well.  When it works I love it, but it is so bug and problem ridden that half of the time I want to rip it out of my truck.  Here is a partial list of the problems and frustrations I have with the unit.    1)  Reception is just plain terrible.  It cannot get stations in as well as the factory radio or my other vehicles radio.  I live probably 30 miles from a major city and getting stations in from that location is hit or miss.    2)  HD Radio goes in and out as station radio signal becomes weaker and stronger, resulting in \\"skipping\\".  The HD radio and the non HD radio have a very slight lag . pause between them.  This gives the effect of \\"skipping\\" as it goes in and out.  Trying to listen to music this way is maddening.  No way to turn the HD radio option off that I can see.  Combined with terrible reception this is a killer for radio use.  3)  The boot up time is terrible.  This is particularly bad when you listening to something and have to shut off the vehicle to run in a store, wait for someone or the like.  The delay between start up and being able to listen to the unit is so long, for short trips I sometimes choose to not use it, although I would like to.    If all of that wasn't bad enough here are the things that are even worse:    4)  The unit has periodic and inconsistent bugs that plague it.  The worst one is that sometimes the screen becomes completely unresponsive.  No matter what you press it will not respond.  Sometimes an icon is highlighted but it will not move.  5) The next bug is that sometimes the unit \\"thinks\\" you are pressing on the screen when you are not.  When using the GPS option (for example) it keeps choosing a menu option for you and when you choose to return to the prior menu it keeps re-selecting the menu option.    Worst of all shutting off and restarting the unit does not solve these problems.  Neither does shutting the vehicle off.  I have to leave the vehicle shut off for several hours before it will behave normally again.  I cannot rely on it, every day is like a hit or miss experience.    6)  Yesterday when I started the unit on, I could see the startup indicator bar on the screen as usual as I waited for it to boot.  Then a blank screen.  No matter what (restarting, waiting a day and trying again) the screen is totally blank, although I know the LCD works because it does display the progress bar each time it boots.    I hope this review helps other people avoid the problems I have faced.  I would NOT buy this unit again if I had it to over again.	2011-06-30

They were 10 foot cables and that was a huge bonus. Unfortunately the first issue is the fact that they are very cheap feeling. Both ends feel like they could break pretty easily and the lightning end even has some small pieces of plastic that are probably left over from the manufacturing processing.<br /><br />I decided that for the price I paid I could live with the chance of them eventually breaking. If the troubles stopped there then I would of probably gave the item three or four stars. Unfortunately that was not the case.<br /><br />The biggest problem with these cables is that I can not get them to sync. They freeze on the 4th step in the syncing process. I even had them freeze up iTunes. The item description clearly states that these cables clearly states that it is compatible with the iPhone 5s without error. It is too bad because I was looking forward to these low price long cables!	2013-11-14

It is a thin cased and does not add significant bulk to the phone.  The material can best be described as a soft plastic.  Since it is thin I'm not sure how much protection it will provide if it fell on a hard surface but then again I don't think it would hurt.  The cutouts and button placements are accurate and I have not problem with power or volume buttons.  Because it is soft it is easy to put on the phone and take off.  It is what I expected. Good case for the money.  Hopefully other reviews can add to their review after a drop.	2013-11-21

You will need to break the plastic &#34;rivets&#34; off the mute switch and heat the plastic standoffs on the new part to secure the switch to the bracket. The new switch sits behind the bracket, so if this is not done properly, the switch will move around inside the phone. The power and volume brackets will adhere to the proper points on the cable using the two sided adhesive already attached to the cable in the appropriate places.<br />This is not a task for the novice. You should have experience doing this type of work and you will need the proper tools. You will have to remove almost everything inside the phone to change the cable.	2014-12-08

Look no further!	Just as the previous poster mentioned, I too have the gold Sprint LG G3, and wasn't going to settle for some off-brand replacement schwag screen for my phone. This thing came in, and I took it to the shop for repairs. I'm not interested in getting hands on, w/ a youtube video for my cell phone repair. I'll let the 'professionals' handle this. (Which is another review entirely)    As for the screen! If you have the gold LG G3, this is what you want. Looks exactly like it did when I took it out of the box. I can't speak entirely for the functionality of the screen, or it's responsiveness, as I immediately had a tempered glass protector placed on at the time of install, but even with that, it's still super responsive and looks GREAT. I didn't touch the thing outside of the plastic, and haven't used the screen without this tempered protection on top of it, but wouldn't have it any other way. No weird issues with jerky movements, or lack of/weird screen occurrences.    I am pleased, and for the price I got this replacement at, I would get another one hands down. If you go into a 'fix-it shop' and have them provide parts AND labor, you'll get whacked over the head. Put it this way, buying this part online, and taking it into the store was less than what you'd spend on deductible for repairs from your cellular insurance. What's not to love? I'll update if I have any issues w/ screen in future (less than 24 hr. usage so far) but right now, I'm a happy camper!	2014-12-12

So I may be addicted to buying cases for my iPhone. Or at least my wife claims I am. So I've been through two hybrid full-coverage cases and a full coverage Speck case I like them all; however, they add a ton of bulk which takes up a ton of pocket space as well as hand space. The full coverage cases may add protection from drops and such but they take away from the wonderful design of the iPhone. In fact, I feel as though you would never know  you have an iphone until you see the front... So I went ahead and ordered this bumper case and it is better than I expected.<br /><br />I have the white iPhone and with this case, the phone looks sleek with the black rubber trim adds a very nice complimentary accent to the phone. That rubber trim also keeps the phone from slipping around on pretty much any surface. The raised ridge of that trim protects the front and the back glass from scratches from resting on flat surfaces. I have a front and back screen/back glass protector along with black tie insurance from Best Buy because I understand that this bumper may not protect against hard drops. It does help with fumbled drops. I dropped it today at the gym in a fumbled drop and the phone was safe and sound. The best part, it fits like a good pair of shoes. All of the buttons works perfectly, headphones and cables fit in the designated holes well. Excellent case!<br /><br />I certainly recommend this bumper to anyone who wants a slim/sleek design and COMPLETELY understands and is okay with the fact that this case isn't designed for hard impacts.	2012-02-25

Phone's fine.<br /><br />But, I was conflicted about this phone from the get go.  I wanted to upgrade from my [[ASIN:B0046CL0VQ LG  Rumor Touch Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile)]] to an Android.  I won't say I regretted it, but I always missed the more solid feel of the LG, despite it not being Android.<br /><br />My irritation has more to do with Samsung's functionality, not reliability.  It seems to take an eternity to boot up.  As some have written, too, the screen is not the most responsive which is a real PITA with maps or news.  Battery life is about what I expected running Android.  However, keyboard is fine, particularly the row of dedicated number keys.  You could do worse.<br /><br />For a budget phone on a budget plan, it's a good starter phone.<br /><br />(When the price came down on the [[ASIN:B0060NG6M2 LG Optimus Slider Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)]], I jumped.  For the more solid LG feel, responsive screen and 2.3, glad I did...but that's another review).	2012-04-03

A note of advice....make sure your initial charging of the battery is done per the accompanying instructions, and that you make sure that the Golf Buddy is turned off after use! After I had initially charged the unit, I walked outside my house (I live on a golf course) to check it out and adjust everything. It came on and performed perfectly, so I was all ready to use it the following day with my group. The next morning when I got to the golf course, I went to turn on the unit and found the battery was dead...I had failed to turn it off the night before!! What a disappointment!	2013-09-19

So glad I followed others' recommendations and bought this product. It's a bargain for the features, comfort, and performance.<br /><br />I was a little nervous about the underear fit/comfort but it is great. Not &#34;I totally forgot it was there&#34; comfortable but excellent for something hanging off your ear. The best I can say about it is that it doesn't pinch or pressure anyone one place too much. I almost always use the cord clip to take pressure off the headset, just to make sure it stays comfortable.<br /><br />The swiveling speaker/earbud for either ear use is a nice feature, especially for those marathon conference call days when you need to switch ears.<br /><br />The sound quality is clear for both parties - no complaints about volume level or background noise. In fact, I think it does a pretty good job of cancelling out background since I keep a heater/fan running in my office and others have said they can't hear it when asked. Definite plus that both the speaker and microphone adjustments are in the in-line controller.<br /><br />Mute button is reliable and I like the green/red indicator...when you remember to use it. I'm still transitioning from using the mute button on my phone (which still works, by the way).<br /><br />I'm a little concerned about the longevity of both the swiveling earpiece and the mute button/slider. Time will tell but I like this unit a lot for now.	2013-01-02

This case is truly waterproof! It really does protect my phone when I go swimming or when I'm just in water. This case is well-built and is very very thin.

The card slots are good as is the money slot behind them.  I will warn that if you want to put more than one card per slot, it becomes difficult to get either card out. I have to carry two forms of ID with me and it is an issue when I need to get one out.<br /><br />The other issue that I have is that the camera does not line up properly. The side that holds the phone does a great job of keeping it snug, but it doesn't slide in enough to line up the camera lens well. If I don't slide the phone out to take a picture, I end up with at least a little to 1/4 of the frame covered by the case. It's almost like having your finger show up on the edge of every picture. Annoying.<br /><br />Overall, the look is great, the price is good and it does (most) of what it should do. If you don't take a ton of pictures with your phone (selfies have the same issue, FYI), you probably won't have an issue. I honestly wish I could get the phone to go down just a little further in the case so I could get past the issue, but I love it otherwise.	2015-01-01

I use it to connect my smartphone, because I have an older car which doesn't have bluetooth.  The only complaint is that to switch the station you want to broadcast to, there are only arrows on the side.  For example, to switch from 101.8 to 105.1 you have to press the up arrow to 101.9- 102.0 - 102.1 etc.  It takes a little while, but otherwise OK because you don't have to do that very often.  The USB connection is nice extra.  I did not have a car charger at all before.  Now I can use my USB charging cable I connected to my laptop and plug it into the car.	2014-09-21

The skin is such a perfect and snug fit, it looks like part of the phone. With it, I feel more confident with protection from accidental drops or hits (although I do not plan to test this) and keeping the battery cover from popping off.<br /><br />The sides have a grippy surface which is a nice touch. The cutouts are dead on, so no function or operation of the phone is compromised. The design for the power button at top works perfectly.<br /><br />I knew the skin was coming from China and prepared for the wait.

US	15447067	R1TFTFQSA3XCRD	B00020KCBA	684784708	Cingular 2 Year Contract	Wireless	3	4	4	N	N	Great Phone Service, Overpriced Data Plans	I switched to Cingular from a local carrier due to better coverage, phone selection, and pricing. I ordered through Amazon due to their amazing prices,  and received the phones in a few short days. I must say, I have been very happy with the service in my town, with fewer dropped calls, stronger signals, and steady service. Just a couple of weeks ago, we had a bout of very nasty weather that knocked out cell service for most carriers in the area for nearly 8 hours. I never experienced a single moment of downtime.    My only problem has been with Cingular's data pricing. I ordered a Samsung Blackjack for both myself and my wife, and was required to purchase unlimited data plans for both to receive the discounted rate. Not a problem, as I use alot of data anyway. However, the folks at Cingular have determined that the Blackjack SMARTPHONE running Windows Mobile SMARTPHONE Edition is not eligible for their SMARTPHONE data connect plan. Instead, they force you to purchase the PDA plan, which is the exact same, identicle plan, offering the exact same access, features, and bandwidth, for twice the price. Cingular's ridiculously high data pricing will inevitably bite them in the long run. As soon as my 6 month agreement with Amazon to keep the data plans is up, they'll be dropped or reduced.    I don't understand the thinking of some companies these days. It's far better to make smaller profits on more customers than to try to reap a fortune off of a few. It's not shocking at all that so many companies these days go from fortune to failure in such a short time. Take heed, \\"The New AT&T\\", people will only tolerate your greed for so long.	2007-04-24

I have had this phone for 6 months and have had to replace it 3 times already. Everytime something goes wrong with the phone, Sprint just gives you a new one.  <br /> <br />The phone never shuts off, even though you think it is shut off. By hitting the button on the top to shut it down, it won't.  <br /> <br />Try dialing a number or anything using the touch screen and you have to wait a few second.  <br /> <br />There is no way to get rid of program icons once you uninstall them. <br /> <br />It is impossible to call someone or text anyone while driving. (I know you not suppose to do it) <br /> <br />The good thing is you can access the internet. But wait, can't you do that already with regular phones?!! <br /> <br />Also, you can not watch tv on these phones either. What's the use for this phone then? <br /> <br />If you have Sprint and they tell you this phone you must purchase a different package, in order to get the internet etc, they are lying to you. Call them and make them switch you back. It's just a bunch of added fees that you do not need as this phone is not compatible. <br /> <br />I wish I never spent the 500.00 on this phone as I could have spent that on a laptop. <br /> <br />As for upgrading to Windows 6 or compatability with Vista--worthless...	2007-05-02

This UNITEK Mutil-in-1 USB3.0 Smart OTG Charging Dock Data Sync Cradle Stand with 3 Port Hub is such a great product to have for anyone who is like me and has tons of gadgets that need to be charged! I've used products before that you can charge multiple devices at once but this is the first one I've used that also has a stand! The stand allows you to charge your device and still use it all while keeping your hands free. I love being able to watch videos while my phone is charging and not have to hold it the entire time.<br /><br />I did notice that the charging speed seems a tad faster than what I'm used to which I love. I like that this charging dock comes with a SD card reader which I think is really different from other similar products. I was able to charge my fiances Iphone,my Galaxy,and my Ipad Mini all at the same time without any problems. This is definitely a very sturdy and well made charging dock and I would definitely recommend!<br /><br />**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**	2015-07-16

The first thing I wanted to do when I got it was run down the battery in order to test how long it would take to charge.  The running down took forever! (which is good).  I used it to charge both my iPhone and iPad.  The iPhone was several times from about 60%.  The iPad was once from about 50% and then I started charging it from about 18%.  It got to 50 before the external battery lost its charge.  The recharge of the external battery took about 6 hours, which was what the manual said to expect from the power source I was using.  I expect to use this extensively for travel...especially for when I have to spend long periods away from power (like when I'm camping).	2014-11-06

Most have disappointed me because of slow charging or poor quality.  Belkin has made a splash with this charger.  I have purchased about 10 of these now for the family.  They are not the cheapest chargers out there but are worth the money.  I like this charger better then the<br /><br />Pro's<br />1.  Swivel plug - this is the best feature of the charger.  You can not plug this into any outlet and not waste the outlet next to it because of the orientation of the plug.<br />2.  Folding plug - the plug folds flat so that it does not get caught on anything while traveling.<br />3.  Consistent power - I tested the amps and voltage and this is one of the most consistent chargers I could find.<br />4.  Universal charging - This charger charges every device that I have as long as the device has a USB plug.  I have tried at least 20 different devices in my house and all charged quickly without problems<br /><br />Cons<br />1.  The price is kinda high when you have to purchase multiple of these.  I would like the price to be close to 10 dollars.<br />2.  These come with a Apple cable that is kinda useless for me.  I do own several Apple devices but rather use the Apple cable that came with the device.  The cable they supply is thick and not very flexible.  The plug on the end is large and bulky also.<br />3.  I would prefer that the charger came with a micro usb cable and an apple cable.  This would be an added benefit to the charger.	2014-04-23

It can pump out a good amount of sound although at full volume on both the speaker and my device the sound tends to clip a bit.  The sound it produces is richer than my phone speaker, probably due to the larger bass output, but by no means is it comparable to a larger speaker.  As a travel speaker this is the best you are gonna get.	2014-04-24

The mount is very high quality and It holds very securely to the handlebars due to the three different rubber spacers included in the box. My only problem is the distance from the handlebars should be a bit longer to facilitate a wider degree of articulation.	2013-11-01

Some people have commented about &#34;sharp&#34; edges.  There is definitely an edge there on the case.  It's not the kinda sharp that will cut you it's the kind that gives you a place for some grip.

Got this because I wanted a slim case that protected my phone and showed it off a bit.  Had it several weeks now and it's still doing great. My phone still remains scratch  free. The case has yellowed slightly but it's only noticeable when the case is not on the phone, But I blame me for that because I do a lot of stuff that gets my hands dirty and I don't always clean my hands properly before using my phone. Anyways, it was a great buy. Fairly cheap and pretty effective.	2013-11-03

The noise level is high enough to hear sound over the noise of the machines, but doesn't produce heat like many other options. The controls located on the earbuds make it simple to control the sound level, tracks, and even making a call with the press of a button. Battery life is excellent, lasting multiple days of heavy use.<br /><br />I also use this pair at the office which keeps me engaged with the sounds around me while also listening to audio and conference calls comfortably. It had quickly become my go-to headset for everything.	2015-04-09

There is no echoing, no background noise, or crackles.  You can easily switch from music to a phone call.  The clarity of the microphone is just as good.  It connects easily to various electronics.  We have tried my iPhone, my husband's Galaxy, and multiple iPods.  Sound quality was equally good on all devices.  The package was delivered without damage and instructions were included.  There was no need to spend time searching online to find out how to pair the headphones with the devices or how to use the features of the headphones.  Volume adjustments are made easily.  They fit comfortably on various sizes of heads and ears.  Overall a great set of headphones.  I was given the opportunity to try these headphones at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-04-10

Context:  I am a high tech professional of twenty-plus years. I have a nav system in my Acura as a point of reference.  My unit came pre-installed with version 5.0 firmware.  I purchased it at the outset of a ten-day multi-state trip to the east coast spanning New York (City), Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. I did a great deal of both driving and walking during the trip, during which I consulted the unit the entire time, including long after I wanted to drop kick it.     Here is a mere partial list of my complaints:    * WebUpdater doesn't recognize my unit when I connect it to my Macbook.  Possible that MissingSync is conflicting with it but I don't care to debug it.    * Didn't work anywhere in Manhattan I frequented (mostly between 34th and 79th).  It briefly acquired satellite contact twice but not long enough to provide any use.      * Doesn't know alternate names of many roads.  So it tells you to turn right on Jackson Street when what you see on the sign is Route 25.    * Sometimes tells you \\"turn right in point one miles\\" when you're driving at 65mph.  Effectively that means \\"turn right at the exit you just passed.\\"  It usually says \\"point two\\" but not always.    * Makes odd suggestions at roundabouts.  \\"Enter roundabout and take the second exit\\" apparently means \\"enter roundabout and exit at the second street you see.\\"  What it really should say is \\"enter and exit roundabout to keep proceeding east.\\"    * Thinks anything with \\"Lodge\\" in the name is a hotel.  Not so when it's an apartment building with \\"Lodge\\" in the name.  Major bummer when you're looking for a hotel in a remote location after midnight with two really cranky kids.    * Doesn't get a signal through an under-insulated one-story cabin tin roof, even when the strength of the signal is full blast right outsidethe front door.    * Doesn't let you pre-plot your next trip when you're in the midst of a current trip.     * No way to \\"unstop\\" a stopped trip.    * Inconsistent way to move back a screen.  On some screens you press \\"Done\\", on most you press \\"Menu.\\"    * \\"Do you want to insert a Via Point here?\\" is a lame way to say \\"Do you want to plan a stop here?\\"    * Robot voice is annoying and totally unnecessary.    * Robotic voice is also confusing.  When it says \\"turn right in point five miles\\" it sounds very close to \\"turn right eight point five miles.\\"  (Pronounce it both aloud in a robotic voice and you'll see what I mean.)    Over the course of my trip I estimate that I spent four hours trying to help this thing help me.  I'd be generous to say it saved me an hour.	2008-01-02

I will be returning this case, as it was the worst-fitting of the three. The case is  just a smidge too big all around, and even while holding the phone in my hand, the opposite edges began to peel away. This case has a great profile, which is thin, and I feel that the material would still protect my phone in case of a fall, the caveat being it will NOT STAY ON. My phone needs to fit in my pants pockets, purse, and smaller hands, and I do not feel that this case is up to the task. With such a large phone, and my hands being small, I do not feel comfortable  leaving my investment in this case. Of the three cases, I kept the Samsung Protective Bumper Cover (which I have also reviewed). Hope this helps, and happy shopping!	2013-07-14

That state and a few others have letters, dashes in rural addresses such as W1234N123 Maple Ave. Most of Wisconsin is like this so unless you only need to find a location in downtown Milwaukee, Madison, or other city you are back to printing out [...] and trying to read and drive at the same time. Now it's possible that a new map download ($50-$80) would cure that but I'd have to spend the money to find out. I also found out, as others have, that Tom Tom customer support basically sucks. Don't expect email replies or to get much phone support. As long as the unit works for you and your locations that doesn't matter though.	2010-01-20

Got the battery in the other day and ran it all the way down then a full recharge.  After that I did not plug it in and it ran for almost three days with my normal (not too heavy) usage.  WOW! A vast improvement over the old battery.  The comments about it being thicker are somewhat subjective.  Yes it is thicker but not unduly so.  The one review about it feeling better while typing are dead on; it's more comfortable now.  We'll see how well it holds up over time but so far I can say its been the best purchase for my G1 yet.	2010-01-25

(By quickly I might mean probably every two years, which isn't that bad.) My most recent purchase was to refresh my battery so that it would not die in less than a day on idle -- but I decided to go for an extended battery. Both the battery and the new cover for the back work extremely well and the way that the phone clips into the belt-clip means that I don't need to get a new one of those.<br /><br />Overall, this battery does its job and the cover looks just fine on the phone.	2012-04-20

The case itself is very sturdy...however, just as my husband was going to apply one of the two covers to his phone, he realized that the tabs were already warped. So we tried the second one, and that one also had a broken tab.  I purchased two of them just in case one would break later on down the road.  However, we didn't expect that they would be mailed already un-usable???  I would really like to have my money back or even two new ones sent with in-tact tabs.  I don't understand why Tmobile or whomever makes these D30 cases don't make them more sturdy.<br /><br />(Oh I know why...so we keep having to buy them...since the money is in the accessories, ultimately.)

Wireless	3	0	0	N	Y	Great band, but Not big enough for Iphone 5	I also bought the I20 because I read reviews saying the I-10 was too \\"short\\" for the iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 fits like a glove inside the I20 and the pouch zipper will close(this is with no case on the phone). However what makes it not work is that the Ear bud opeing located on the bottom side of the pouch is on the bottom right (the aux hole is on the bottome left of the iphone 5)  After you plug in your ear buds to your phone you have to feed the cord along the bottom of the phone/pouch to drop out of the pouch hole which prevents the phone from being flush & then you're unable to zip it closed....This is a quick fix -PUT A HOLE ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT OF THE POUCH. =((( Sadly, I will have to return this product.	2013-05-13

You can only fit one card or driver license.. I had to separate my vehicle and insurance cards and store them separately<br />Overall great product, though I am not sure it will last as long as the typical case without the slots.. but for the price I paid it is a complete hassle free for me	2014-02-28

I bought this to replace a similar case that was much more expensive. The base plate broke so that the phone would come out of it easily. This one seems well-made and the rough finish allows you to get a good grip. The base holds it quite firmly. I don't really use the stand but it is easy-to-use if you want.<br />In summary, a protective case for the phone with a good holster that holds the phone snugly but you can get it out easily enough when you want to. I am satisfied.	2014-03-02

This is perfect for travel or tossing in a laptop bag or purse. The electrical prongs fold up easily, and all the edges are rounded off, making for a really good device.<br /><br />There is one small caveat with this adapter - it will only output 2.1 Amps at 5 Volts. That means you can charge an iPad or any other super power hungry devices at the highest charging rate (and it absolutely does that), but you cannot charge another device at the same time. If you try to do that, both will revert to the 1 Amp rate - moderate speed for an iPad and fast for an iPhone. Just be aware, you cannot charge to big power hungry devices at the same time with this.<br /><br />The adapter can accept 110 to 240V input, meaning this will work in Europe. You will only need a European to US prongs adapter. In Europe these are about a dollar at any hardware store. In the US, they are more like $10-5 depending on who puts their brand name on them.<br /><br />Because this is so small, you'll need an electrical outlet, extension cord, or a power strip nearby to use it. The USB outlets are far enough away that you can easily plug a cord in.<br /><br />I was provided a review sample.	2014-10-09

The people reviewing these that say they are great have never used a good iPhone screen protector. I have bought TONS of screen protectors for 5 different iPods (touch) and 3 different iPhones. These are terrible. The material they use just plain bites, and makes it feel like you are dragging your finger through soft, sticky plastic. You lose that silky feeling you normally have on the iPhone screen. There are many other brands out there that still provide that smooth as silk feeling while still protecting your screen. Halo is one brand that do these quite well among others. So don't be drawn in like I did with, \\"Ooh! there are 6 in this pack!\\"<br /><br />Thankfully these are cheap so I didn't mind throwing them in the trash and then ordering a couple of 3 packs of the Halo branded ones.	2011-10-27

Wireless	2	0	0	N	Y	Terrible for Exercise	These might be the worst headphones I have ever bought. This was the second pair of these that I have had because the first pair just stopped working after a week. I bought these on a recommendation from two coworkers. I returned the first pair and got my money back. I decided to give them another try cause I found them for $19.99 so I figured why not cause at the time it was showing the original price was $129.00 and I figured what a deal and if the originally sold for $129 they must be pretty good. Wrong!!! It said a 30 foot range on the Bluetooth but if I just sit my phone down to do an exercise at the gym with it two feet away it cuts in and out or cuts out completely. I have tried to run with them holding my phone and they were absolutely useless and I had to take them off. It's a shame because when they are not cutting out they have decent sound and that and the fact that I only paid $20 is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Please take into consideration the type of activity you will be doing if you purchase these because if you are planning on exercising then you will be disappointed but if you are going to be sitting still at a desk you may be ok.	2015-08-13

It absolutely lives up to all the claims lifeproof makes about it.  I never purposefully sought to test its limits, but life did it for me.  Last month my 1 year old fell in the pool.  He cannot swim yet, and I had to dive in to get him.  My phone was still in my pocket, but with the case on it was not an issue.  With other phones, they’ve gone to the waste bin for this kind of thing.  Mine is still going.  The sound with the case on is still quite good, although it’s even better when I open the charging port.<br />The best part so far has been the customer service.  After 10 months of use the case was looking tired, had a small section break off on the corner, and had worn through the rubber seal in one corner.  The phone was still in perfect shape btw.  I sent pictures to lifeproof and that same day they put a replacement in the mail for me.  Lifeproof has gained a loyal customer.  I’m getting the nuud cover for my ipad next.	2014-08-07

I got this phone for my husband because he is very rough with phones, I was having to get him a new one every 4-6 months. I was skeptical at first because of the reviews but I am glad that I decided to get it for him, he has had it for over a year now and it still works GREAT!!! The sound quality isn't the best but he doesn't care at all, he is an elevator tech and he dropped it down an elevator shaft about 50 feet onto concrete and it didn't phase it at all. He is very happy and so am I!!	2010-02-21

After dropping my last BlackBerry and upgrading to a Tour a few friends recommended the Otterbox Defender series to me so I decided to give it a try.  The only negative reviews I could find said that the case was very bulky and that it made the outer buttons hard to press.  I couldn't disagree more with those negative comments.    The case goes on very easily, it took maybe 2 minutes and it's a perfect fit.  The form factor of the phone is almost the same as without the case, just slightly larger.  I personally feel that the phone fits better in my hands with the case, and the rubberized cover definitely makes the phone easier to hold on to.  I haven't had any problems hitting the outer keys, and I have very large hands.  I can't imagine anyone having enough of a problem with those keys that it would outweigh the benefits on the case.  It is rock solid and uses high quality materials for a PERFECT fit.  The camera still takes the same quality pictures, even with the hard plastic lens cover, and the screens colors haven't been affected at all.  Actually, with this case on there is LESS glare on the screen than without the case.    I was skeptical about the plastic cover that goes over the keyboard, but I decided to try it anyways.  I'm glad I did, because it's great.  It's so much easier to wipe the keys off, and debris from my jacket pocket can no longer get in between the keys.  I hardly even notice it's there anymore.  My only complaint is that the case should really come with a few of these covers, as I'm guessing after a little while the plastic will start to discolor and wear out.    Bottom line:  If you care about protecting your phone, look no further.  I would gladly have paid twice what I did for the Otterbox.  This thing is so rock solid, if you dropped your phone on concrete I'd be more worried about damaging the floor than the phone!	2010-03-12

I can't emphasize this enough. Tempered glass is still the greatest way to protect the lcd on your phone. Regardless of what phone you have, it will basically ensure that the glass on your phone will remain intact for almost any damage it might sustain.<br /><br />This is no different with the 6plus tempered glass. Almost all tempered glass is the same hardness and same thickness. The ACD26L is also somewhat on the cheaper side, which is probably the most important factor when deciding amongst the different brands.<br /><br />It's super easy to put on with the accessories that come with it. Including the microfiber cloth and static tape. The flaps on the opposite side of the screen make it easy to align with the phone and place the protector on you phone in one shot.<br /><br />Regardless of what case I ever use, I MUST have the tempered glass. Best protection you can buy for a phone. It's much easier to put on that film and much more effective.	2014-11-19

This cable hooked up easily..had plenty of length to be able to route it under the tank and directly to the GPS.  PLUS.. it has an ON/OFF switch which makes it easy to shut down when bike is turned off.  (It is also fused.. to protect any overload)  This is a great option and I would recommend it to anyone who has a motorcycle and wants to direct wire their GPS to the battery.	2014-06-10

This APXX 2 pack works great.  I tested these on my meter and they tested perfect every time.  I like that these are smart ports and can distinguish the difference between my iPad and iPhone.  I found myself always looking to see if I was plugging into a lightning cable attached to an iPhone block or an iPad block. If you have both a phone and a tablet, you know that an iPad doesn't like to charge on an iPad block. Sure it will charge but it takes FOREVER because the power adapter limits the charge rate to 5W not the 12W that an iPad block can provide. I also have multiple apple power blocks plugged into one power strip just so I can charge multiple devices at the same time. That's where this device comes in. You just plug multiple lightning or micro usb cables into this one device, and you can charge up to 6 devices from one power brick. Having 12 available ports lets me have availability to every device I own at once.  It makes life easier and faster. That's why I wanted this item.  I was supplied a test sample to evaluate, test and review.	2015-07-03

I've had this phone for a little over a month now. The phone cannot find the 4g that comes with my network service (T-Mobile) and since I bought the phone unlocked, I tried to put another sim card with a different company (AT&T) it still couldn't find the 4g or 3g. Also, the phone does not automatically remember the WiFi setting and if the screen goes to sleep, I will either have to wait for it to find the WiFi again or start it back up manually/ When trying to download more than one app or play a game/Facebook while trying to download something in the background, the phone runs slower. When trying to use the zoom on the camera, the photos don't come out very well. On the upside, the sleek look & light weight make for easy carrying and the screen is HUGE (but watching attempting to watch Netflix with the app is a joke!) I love the shortcuts and all other features on the phone & for the price (~$220 + unlocked/no warranty) it's a good bang for your buck, but in today's high-end Smart Phone world, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this phone.	2012-12-28

We use this on the dash all the time and it doesn't move at all. We even bring this inside and set it on a tripod, at an angle, and it sticks our phones perfectly in place for making videos.  My only complaint can easily be controlled by me because when on the dash my phone will come at me when I get on the gas real hard...so the solution is not to get into the accelerator so hard :) Other than that this thing stays put, the phone stays put and this gets a LOT of use.  It's a great product.	2015-02-07

Came in a gorgeous box, would make a great present for the busy bee. It does take longer to charge your phone but its very convenient because you can just plug it in, drop it in your purse and forget about it while it charges. It heats up as the charger itself is charging but turns itself off once its fully charged and cools down which I like (means I'm not burning out the battery). The USB end and the cord seems very well made. Its very genius how they made the 3 in one part of the other end but it seems not as well made as the USB, although that might just be because there's so many little parts.	2015-03-21

I loved this case, it has influenced many of my cellphone case purchases since I originally bought it.<br />The look and style is wonderful. It easily hid small scuffs, scrapes, and scratches. It held my phone pretty solidly, however the cheap plastic case/part that clips the phone into the rest of the case broke a lot faster than I would have liked so I did not get too much use out of it. Also, there were several loose threads that unravelled constantly and the edges quickly started to look frayed, haggard, and really unappealing.<br />I loved this case, just wish it had been a little higher quality. For the price, it really was a good case though.	2013-11-23

The side buttons work wonderfully with the inner covering and I've dropped my GS3 a few times without worry.

I have to say that the craftsmanship in this case is excellent, sporting high quality materials. However, after using the case for just one day at work, I found it is not very functional. I travel regularly between sites as part of my daily job duties and I am in my car for a significant part of the day. Not only it is difficult to answer a call, but also awkward as you need both hands to use the case comfortably. All in all the case is a beautifully crafted product, but not practical.	2014-03-31
